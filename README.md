## Project Type :
Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling
## Problem Statement :
The project aims to analyze individuals' financial and demographic characteristics to identify key factors influencing creditworthiness and financial behavior. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing robust credit scoring models and customer segmentation strategies, which are essential in financial decision-making. By leveraging this dataset, we can explore relationships between income, credit limits, credit ratings, and demographic factors such as age, education, and marital status.
## Motivation :
Credit scoring and customer segmentation are vital for financial institutions to assess risk, design targeted marketing, and create tailored financial products. Given the rise of personalized financial services, it's important to understand how various demographic and financial factors interact to influence an individual's creditworthiness. This project will provide insights into the behavior patterns of different groups, which can help in designing better credit risk models.
## Previous Work :
Credit risk modeling has been extensively researched, focusing on income, credit history, and repayment behavior. Customer segmentation has also been applied in the financial sector to identify unique market segments based on income and spending habits. Existing studies often highlight the importance of age, education, and marital status in influencing financial behavior, which I plan to build upon.
## Approach :
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will first conduct a detailed EDA to understand the distributions, correlations, and relationships among the various features (e.g., rating vs income, age vs balance).

3.	Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and decision trees, I will develop credit risk models to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on demographic and financial features.

4.	Customer Segmentation: Employ clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to identify distinct customer segments that exhibit similar financial behaviors.

5.	Validation: The models and clusters will be validated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, learning curve and area under roc curve.

## Potential Applications :
•	Credit Risk Models : Assist financial institutions in predicting credit risk.<br>
•	Targeted Financial Products : Help identify customer segments to design personalized financial offerings.<br>
•	Financial Education : Support the development of education programs tailored to specific demographic groups.<br>
## Future Directions :
 This project will serve as a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing financial behavior, with applications in both financial institutions and broader public policy.
